Our company is focused on pizza sales, and to effectively track and analyze our performance, we need a comprehensive Pizza Sales Dashboard in Power BI.

**Objective**: 
Design and develop a dynamic, interactive Pizza Sales Dashboard that visualizes critical KPIs related to pizza sales. The dashboard will help us understand our sales performance over time and make data-driven decisions.

### Chart Requirements:
- **Weekly Trend for Total Orders**:  
  Bar chart illustrating weekly total order trends. Highlighted the day with the most sales using conditional formatting.
  
- **Monthly Trend for Total Orders**:  
  Line chart showing total orders by month with markers for clear identification of trends.
  
- **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**:  
  Pie chart displaying sales distribution across pizza categories.

  Bar chart showcasing the bottom 5 worst-selling pizzas with conditional formatting.

### Steps Followed:

1. **Data Quality Check / Data Cleaning**:  
   - **Load Data**: Imported the dataset from SQL Server into Power BI Desktop.  
     ![SQL Server](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61c2b3a8-12e1-4a6f-a98f-b64d1481ee8d)
     
   - **Data Quality Check**: Used Power Query Editor to remove null values and filter rows.  
     ![Data Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb898399-fecc-4351-8f5d-1400550210bf)
     
   - **Replace Values**: Standardized data in the 'pizza_size' column using Power Query.  
     ![Replace Value](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c805197-80ee-47c8-aa49-7382b0302743)

2. **Enhanced Data Visualization with DAX**:  
   - **Create Day of the Week Column**:  
     Used Power Queryâ€™s Add Column to extract the day name from the order date.  
     ![Creating Date Name](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37ed8724-9213-409d-b6e6-7d929abb4b53)

3. **DAX Calculations**:
   - Created a column for month ordering:  
     ```DAX
     Month Order = MONTH(pizza_sales[order_date])
     ```
     
   - Shortened day and month names:  
     ```DAX
     Order Day = UPPER(LEFT(pizza_sales[Day Name], 3))
     Order Month = UPPER(LEFT(pizza_sales[Month Name], 3))
     ```
     
   - Created custom day names using DAX:  
     ```DAX
     Week Day = FORMAT(pizza_sales[order_date], "DDDD")
     ```
     
   - Ordered weekdays numerically:  
     ```DAX
     Week Order = WEEKDAY(pizza_sales[order_date])
     ```

4. **KPIs and Measures**:

   - **Total Revenue**:  
     ```DAX
     Total Revenue = SUM(pizza_sales[total_price])
     ```

   - **Average Order Value**:  
     ```DAX
     Average Order Value = [Total Revenue] / [Total Orders]
     ```  
     ![Average Order Value](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7a1d37e-6ec1-44e1-80c1-f1e184f845c8)
     
   - **Total Pizzas Sold**:

   - **Total Orders**:  
     ```DAX
     Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(pizza_sales[order_id])
     ```
